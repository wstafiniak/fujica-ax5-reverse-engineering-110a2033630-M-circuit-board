# Fujica AX-5 – Bottom PCB Reverse Engineering

This project documents the **reverse engineering of the bottom PCB from the Fujica AX-5 camera**.  
The work focuses on analyzing the original electronic layout, identifying components and
connections, recreating the schematic, and designing a **new replacement PCB** using EasyEDA.

The project is intended for **educational and documentation purposes**, aimed at electronics
enthusiasts, analog camera technicians, and anyone interested in preserving and repairing
vintage photographic equipment.

## Notes

- This project does **not include official manufacturer documentation**.
  All schematics and layouts are the result of independent analysis and reconstruction.
- Errors are possible — corrections, feedback, and contributions are welcome.
- The project is shared to help preserve technical knowledge of classic analog cameras.
